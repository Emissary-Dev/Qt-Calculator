# Qt-Calculator

## About
This calculator mimics the iPhone calculator app, which can perform operations on multiples sets of values, handle decimal/negative values, and clear the display when you enter an unwanted value without resetting the equation. 

It was quite a challenge to get this app working as every calculator tutorial I could find dealt with no more than 2 sets of values at a time and I had little to no experience in building a calculator that goes beyond those boundaries. With that being said, lots of trial and error as well as comparisons between this app and the iPhone calculator were implemented to improve accuracy. It's not perfect, but I think I got pretty close; Try it for yourself :) 

-This project uses the Qt Creator library for the ui and code
-I may come back from time to time to fix bugs and maybe add quality of life updates if there is a demand for them
